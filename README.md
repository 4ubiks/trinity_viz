# trinity_viz

repository for Liberty Rocketry, centered around data communication for the rocket's visualizer. enabling communication between a C# based Unity project and Python code grabbing the necessary data. 

## goals:
creating a system that allows real-time data transmission from a receiver to our ground station (primarily using Python for functionality), communicating with Unity (C#) to project live data onto a 3D render of our rocket's launch.
